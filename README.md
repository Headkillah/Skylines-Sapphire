# Quartz

Quartz is a UI reskin framework/ mod for Cities: Skylines build from the original source of [Sapphire](https://github.com/AlexanderDzhoganov/Skylines-Sapphire). It enables authors to create their own skins for the game using simple XML syntax and publish them as mods on the workshop. 

This project would not have been possible without the great work done by Alexander Dzhoganov on the original Sapphire
